This is a TiddlyWiki plugin for using pseudocode.js.

It is completely self-contained, and doesn't need an Internet connection in order to work. It works both in the browser and under Node.js.

It is currently based on [[pseudocode.js v1.0.0|http://www.tatetian.io/pseudocode.js]]

Note that this plugin requires the katex plugin from TiddlyWiki to work properly.
